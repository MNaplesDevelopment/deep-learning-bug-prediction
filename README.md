# deep-learning-bug-prediction

I am also working on a more advanced model at https://github.com/TeamLigers/bug-prediction

# Tuning hyperparameters:

To alter the number of neurons in the hidden layer, change n_h on lines 47 and 63, and change the parameter on line 243 to match.

The number of iterations can also be changed on 243.

The learning rate can be changed on line 214.
